## Barnell

### Overview 
This program is a simple tool designed to help teachers grade the Barnell Loft
Diagnostic Spelling Test. Teacher provide either the questions students got correctly, or the
questions the students got incorrectly, and the program will output the results for each category.

### Installation 
This tool was built with Scala 3 and sbt. You will need both of these tools in order to use the
program.


### Usage
Clone the project into the desired directory, and run: `sbt run` to start the program.


### Considerations
I understand that Scala is not very intuitive for people to install and use, but I wanted to test
the language out with a very simple project for my sister. If enough people use it, I can create an
App for it or just port it to either Java or Python for easier usage.
